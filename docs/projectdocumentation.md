# Kasparro Applied AI Engineer Challenge: Multi-Agent Content Generation System

## Problem Statement
The objective was to design and implement a modular agentic automation system that takes a specific small product dataset (GlowBoost Vitamin C Serum) and automatically generates structured, machine-readable content pages (FAQ Page, Product Description Page, Comparison Page). The system needed to operate without external LLM APIs, relying instead on deterministic rules, templates, and a multi-agent orchestration architecture within a React/Vite Single Page Application.

## Solution Overview
This solution is a client-side React application acting as a content generation pipeline. It simulates an "Agentic" workflow where specialized hooks (Agents) perform distinct tasks—parsing, generating ideas, assembling content, and rendering outputs. 

The system treats the React component tree as the execution environment and `useEffect` hooks as the temporal orchestrators. It processes the raw JSON input through a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of operations to produce three distinct JSON artifacts, downloadable directly from the browser.

## Scopes & Assumptions
1.  **Tech Stack**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite. No backend or external AI APIs.
2.  **Input Data**: Strictly limited to the provided JSON object.
3.  **Content Logic**: "Intelligent" behavior is simulated via string manipulation rules, conditional templates, and keyword matching.
4.  **Product B**: As requested, the comparison product ("RadiantGlow Serum") is hardcoded within the system's logic to facilitate the comparison page generation.
5.  **Persistence**: Files are generated in-memory as Blobs for download; the `public/outputs` folder structure is simulated via the download filenames.

## System Design

### 1. Agent Responsibilities
The system is divided into functional units called "Agents", implemented as custom React Hooks to leverage state and lifecycle management.

*   **DataParserAgent**: Acts as the gatekeeper. It validates the raw input schema and normalizes it into a strongly-typed `ProductModel`.
*   **QuestionGeneratorAgent**: Responsible for creative ideation. It uses a template bank to deterministically generate exactly 15 questions across "Informational", "Usage", and "Safety" categories based on product attributes.
*   **ContentAssemblerAgent**: The "worker bee". It calls specific *Logic Blocks* (see below) to generate the actual text content for answers, descriptions, and comparisons.
*   **TemplateRendererAgent**: The formatter. It takes raw text/data fragments and structures them into the final JSON schemas required for the output pages.
*   **JsonOutputAgent**: (Integrated into OutputDisplay) Handles the serialization and file download mechanisms.
*   **OrchestratorAgent**: The generic manager. It runs the pipeline steps in sequence: Parse -> Generate Questions -> Assemble -> Render -> Display.

### 2. Logic Blocks (The "Skills")
Agents rely on granular, reusable functions called blocks:
*   `useGenerateBenefitsBlock`: Expands comma-separated benefits into marketing copy.
*   `useExtractUsageBlock`: Formats usage instructions with time-of-day advice.
*   `useCompareIngredientsBlock`: Parses numeric concentrations to determine which product is stronger/milder.
*   `useFormatPriceBlock`: Standardizes currency and tax info.
*   `useSafetyWarningBlock`: Constructs warnings based on skin type and side effects.

### 3. Orchestration Flow (DAG)

```text

   v
[DataParserAgent] -> (ProductModel)
   |
   +-----------------------+
   |                       |
   v                       v
[QuestionGeneratorAgent]   [ContentAssemblerAgent]
(Generates 15 Qs)          (Prepares Logic Blocks)
   |                       |
   +-----------+-----------+
               |
               v
    [TemplateRendererAgent]
    (Merges Answers & Blocks into Schemas)
               |
               v
      [Output Generation]
      (FAQ, Product, Comparison JSONs)
```

### 4. Template Structure
Templates are defined as TypeScript functions returning specific interfaces (`GeneratedFAQPage`, `GeneratedProductPage`, etc.). They are intentionally logic-less, accepting only processed data to ensure separation of concerns between *logic* (Assembler) and *presentation* (Renderer).
